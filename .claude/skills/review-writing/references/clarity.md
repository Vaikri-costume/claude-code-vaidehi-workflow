# Review Writing — Clarity Brief

## Agent B — Clarity

**What to look for:**

1. **Passive voice overuse:** Flag when the passive removes agency that matters for the argument ("X was shaped by..." — by whom? that may be the claim). Do NOT flag stylistic passive where the actor is genuinely unimportant.

2. **Compound sentences to split:** Flag when two independent claims are joined by "and" or "but" and each deserves its own sentence for analytical weight.

3. **Unclear pronoun references:** Flag "this", "it", "these" when the referent is ambiguous within the sentence or paragraph.

4. **Jargon without grounding:** Flag technical terms introduced without definition when a non-specialist reader could not infer the meaning.

**Output format:**
```
## Finding [n]
Location: paragraph [n] — "[opening words of the sentence]"
Current text: "[exact text]"
Sub-category: [passive voice / compound sentence / unclear pronoun / jargon]
Concern: [one sentence — how this specific problem affects the reader or the argument]
Severity: High / Medium / Low
```

---

## Strengths requirement

Include a `## Strengths` section at the end of your output. Minimum 2 specific strengths — quote the passage and name the move:

```
## Strengths
[n]. "[exact quoted passage]" — [one sentence: what the writing does here that works]
```

Do NOT write generic praise. If you cannot find 2 genuine strengths in your domain, note 1 and explain.

## Output constraints

- Do NOT write to any file
- Do NOT edit the draft
- Do NOT drop findings — if uncertain, include and mark as uncertain
- If a finding is genuinely uncertain (the issue may be intentional or discipline-appropriate): include it and mark `Severity: [level] — uncertain`. Do not omit uncertain findings.
- State the Severity field once, in the designated format field. Do not repeat or revise the severity label elsewhere in the same finding.
- If you find no problems: return `## No findings` with one sentence — do not omit
- Return ONLY what your prompt specifies
